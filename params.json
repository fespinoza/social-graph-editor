It is an open source project, so feel free to use, extend and learn from this code.\r\n\r\nIt is a social network graphs modeling tool to assits researchers that uses the study of social networks in their\r\nrespective disciplines and allows them generate this data with a nice interfaces and export it in RDF/N3 format.\r\n\r\nAlso it has the capability of join social network data from two different users, giving users of this\r\napplication a way of interacting with each other and complement their information.\r\n\r\nThe application is currently running on http://social-graph-editor.herokuapp.com and this is a video explaining how\r\nthe app works\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/djEWuTyqOjQ\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n\r\n## Development\r\n\r\n### Installation for the Development Environment\r\n\r\nI have provided a vagrant box with chef recipes to speed up the setup for development, so, \r\nfirst you need to install chef in your machine which can be found on [the official vagrant site](http://vagrantup.com),\r\nso the first time you use vagrant and install this project you have to use the following terminal\r\ncommands from the vagrant directory of this project\r\n\r\n    vagrant up\r\n    vagrant ssh\r\n    cd /sge\r\n    ruby global 1.9.3-p327\r\n    bundle install\r\n    rbenv rehash\r\n    rake db:create; rake db:migrate\r\n    \r\nAfter that you can run the server with the command\r\n\r\n    rails s\r\n    \r\nWhich will run the rails server, so you can access the app through the url `http://localhost:3000`\r\n\r\nNow on, every time you want to launch the development enviroment just execute the following commands from\r\nthe project's vagrant directory:\r\n\r\n    vagrant up\r\n    vagrant ssh\r\n    cd /sge\r\n    rails s\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n\r\n* the RDF-N3 gem fail with ruby 2.0 specifically in the RDF::N3::Reader that\r\n  returns nil\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
